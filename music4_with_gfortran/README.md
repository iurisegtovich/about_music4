# about_music4

this repository contains
in the file named "DEBUGGING_music4_for_compatibility_with_gfortran"
the modifications that allowed me to compile the drivers mapmaker.F90 and mapdisplay.F90 using gfortran ( gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.1) )
and in the file named "Instructions"
a report of usage that I wrote when i used the codes in a assignment for a molecular simulation course.

note that the full src code is not here because snurr, in his website, was willing to share the code freely for academics, but subject to personal contact via email
